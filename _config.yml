description: "Hi! I'm an undergrad at the University of California, Berkeley studying Economics, CS, and Stat. My passion is for random events and probability, and I am particularly interested in using statistical and computational models to better understand and gain deeper insight into financial markets. In my free time, I enjoy learning chess, doing outdoorsy stuff like hiking and kayaking, as well as trying new restaurants. One of my hobbies is taking photos of food â€” [click here](/food) if you want to check out some of the best food I've ever eaten. \n [Resume](/files/JohnWang_DS_2024%20(2).pdf) \n [Contact](/contact-me) \n ![LinkedIn](/images/linkedin.png)(https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-j-wang/) ![GitHub](/images/github.png)(https://github.com/john-j-wang) ![Chess.com](/images/chess.png)(https://www.chess.com/member/ilr13s)"
