bio: |
  I am a graduate student in the Mathematics of Finance (MAFN) program 
  at Columbia University. Previously, I did my undergrad at UC Berkeley, triple majoring in Statistics,
  Economics, and DS. My interests lie in machine learning, computer vision, and NLP. 
  
  Currently, I am working on a fast method of photorealistic image transfer that takes linear time. 
  Outside of my work, I enjoy trying new restaurants, going on hikes, and taking photos of nature.
